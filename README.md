# The Fonexpert Phone Shop (Flask-based)

A project built during my university coursework to explore Flask web development, database design and inventory 
management logic. This system allows merchants to manage items and sales records, with potential additions such 
as tracking stock levels that can be implemented into this Flask application. This project also demonstrates how 
multiple Flask applications can be deployed behind a single server running NGINX, alongside my main portfolio site.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Context
This project was originally developed as part of the Cloud Application Development module while studying Computing 
with Software Development at Munster Technological University. I have since refined this application as part of my 
portfolio to demonstrate practical Flask development and deployment skills.
